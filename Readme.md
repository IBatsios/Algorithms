##### _To stay sharp, I am adding algorithms and data structures to my git repository._

# Algorithms

1. Prime Numbers
   - Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. Binary Search
   - O(log n) search implementation
3. Fibonacci Sequence
   - Memoization (less likely to fail because of storage space)
   - Recursively

# Data Structures
